"draiver" company help center for united states
for drivers:
- Why am I not getting trip notifications? The Trip notifications are exclusive to our active drivers. If you are in the process of registration or in area hold you will not receive trip offers. As an active driver, the notification is a result of a variety of factors such as: Availability - Make sure you are logged in to your account with an available status on the app. Notifications - Notifications should be enabled, we recommend reading How Do I Troubleshoot Notification Problems to make sure these are set up correctly. Trip demand in your area - There might be a low number of trips in the region for your category (CDL driver, Personal or Company Chase). Location enabled - Verify your location services are enabled, if they are not turned on we don't know what trips are in your proximity. Our system sends push notifications for those closer to the trip starting point. Trip preferences - Ensure that you are set as Available, since trips will not be sent to you if you are set to Unavailable. You can also check what your trip preferences are, as limiting those can affect how many opportunities match your preferences. 
- How do I troubleshoot notification problems? The first thing you need to check is whether or not notifications are enabled and registered. To do this go into the app under Settings > Notifications > Check Notifications and click the "Send Test Notification" button. If you do not receive the test notification it means notifications are not enabled or there is an issue with your registration. To verify notifications are enabled: Go to your phone (not App) settings. Smartphones have different menus, but it's often under Settings > App/Applications > DRAIVER. On that screen (or under a notifications section) there is often an option to toggle or check to allow notifications as well as specific notification preferences (such as sound). Make sure you have enabled these and test again. If you still do not receive notifications, it's likely an issue with your phone's push registration. To renew your push registration, logout of the app and back in. After testing if you find that you still do not receive notifications, please contact support. 
- What is the seatbelt policy? Safety belt use is mandatory. It is DRAIVER policy that every operator of equipment and all occupants of any vehicle must wear safety belts while completing Trip Transactions using the DRAIVER mobile app. This applies to all customer-owned vehicles as well as personally-owned, rented, or leased chase vehicles operated by the independent contractor or in which you are a passenger during a Trip Transaction. 
- My phone notification showed me a trip request but I cannot see it when I look in the app Most trips are “First Come, First Serve” trips which means many drivers can see and accept the same trip request you are seeing. Depending on how many drivers are needed and the speed at which those spots are accepted by the time you attempt to view the trip from the trip list, it is no longer available. 

for clients:
- What are some trip creation best practices? Trips can be built using different methods but at DRAIVER we have identified the following best practices to ensure the proper trip creation is executed. Create trips with agility in mind, drivers must always follow instructions carefully so you make the best use of drivers’ time when creating a trip. Start location will routinely be the dealership/location. Add clear instructions for drivers to complete  in trip notes, and add necessary tasks to be completed at each location. Location of keys, gate/lock codes. Ensure the trip starts and ends within the hours of operation at all locations. Make sure to always verify the different chase options to ensure the best cost option is considered for the trip you are creating. Expedited trips carry an additional fee and the potential of drivers being unavailable. Take into account the travel time a driver will need when setting the trip START time. Make sure units are not buried behind others. Bringing multiple vehicles to the same destination can increase efficiency. 1/1, 2/2 etc. swaps are most efficient and eliminate the need for Chase Driver(s). Be sure drivers can park their vehicle during the trip  and have access at the end of trip.
