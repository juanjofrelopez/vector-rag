### Frequently Asked Questions

Draiver Perks is a perks program for drivers that rewards your efforts. Points are earned by taking trips and will determine your Draiver Perks status. The higher your status, the more rewards you can unlock such as perks that are 100% covered at Diamond status.

Your status is based on the points you accumulated through miles driven or trips completed in the last 3-month period, which corresponds to one of the following quarters: January-March, April-June, July-September, or October-December.

You accumulate points during a fixed 3-month period (_October-December, January-March, April-June, or July-September_). At the start of a 3-month period, your status is determined by the points you earned in the previous 3-month period. At the end of the period, you can move up statuses and unlock more rewards if you earn enough points for the next status, or you can maintain your current status when you reach the minimum number of points or be downgraded in status if you do not reach the established minimum score.

In order to keep your current perks, you must maintain a Silver, Gold, or Diamond status. If your Draiver Perks status falls below Silver (with no completed trips), you’ll lose benefits for the next cycle (_3-month cycles: October-December, January-March, April-June, or July-September_). To reclaim available perks, you must requalify for Silver, Gold, or Diamond status for the next cycle.

Your biweekly status will be sent from Draiver via email.

WebDoctors is an online telemedicine portal where you can have access to a board-certified physician in your area 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More details here: https://www.webdoctors.com/faq/.

Eligible drivers can extend their health perks to family members by paying an additional fee. Eligible family members (up to 3) include: Spouse or domestic partner, Child/Dependent, Parent, or legal guardian.

At WebDoctors.com, they specialize in addressing common, easily diagnosable day-to-day medical problems. Examples of the conditions they treat include upper respiratory tract infections (URI’s), STDs, bladder or urinary tract infections, pink eye, ear infections, skin rashes like poison ivy, allergic rhinitis, and flu syndrome, among others. The board-certified physicians at WebDoctors.com can offer audio/video consultations and send electronic prescriptions to the pharmacy of your choice.

For general information about WebDoctors, you can always reach out at: https://www.webdoctors.com/contact-us/

No, to be eligible for the program you need to complete at least one trip over the quarter. Only active drivers are able to receive and complete trips

You can find more information about the tier’s benefits above.

Drivers who have achieved Silver, Gold, or Diamond status through the Draiver Perks program in the U.S. are eligible. To start enjoying their perks, drivers must complete registration on WebDoctors’ and Avibra’s platform.

Avibra is a free app that provides benefits for everyone. You can start by earning insurance coverage at no cost to you through their Well-Being Advisor. Then explore all of the $1/week benefits in the Dollar Benefits Store. Their mission is to provide everyone with affordable, accessible coverage while improving your health, finances, career, relationships, and community in the process.

Each of their benefits differs in processes, but they’ve made it very easy to find everything you need to file a claim. Access your documents, instructions, and FAQs within each benefit menu in their app. If you still have questions, please contact Avibra.

Certainly. Avibra believes that everyone should have access to affordable benefits, and they have developed a distinctive method to provide these benefits through their Dollar Benefits Store. Avibra offers a range of benefits, from critical illness insurance to cell phone protection, allowing individuals to customize their benefits package according to their specific needs, all priced at just $1 per week per benefit. Avibra can offer these cost-effective rates by employing a similar principle to purchasing items in bulk at a lower cost, akin to shopping at Costco, where they leverage group discounts for their users.

Their mission is to make affordable and accessible benefits available to everyone. Instead of allocating funds towards extensive advertising campaigns, they prioritize investing in their community. Coverage expenses are covered on behalf of individuals, and this is achieved through strategic collaboration with the Alliance of Well-Being Association (myAllWell), a non-profit organization that shares a similar mission and vision. Together, they have partnered to establish a well-being economy. When individuals join Avibra and become members, whether it’s a free or paid membership, they automatically become part of the myAllWell non-profit community. In the event that additional benefits are needed, Avibra offers supplementary insurance options for just $1 per week.

For general information about your insurance policies, you can always reach out at hello@avibra.com or check more details here: https://www.avibra.com/contact-us
